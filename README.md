Problem Statement:

The e-commerce business is quite popular today. Here, you do not need to take orders by going to each customer. A company launches its website to sell the items to the end consumer, and customers can order the products that they require from the same website. Famous examples of such e-commerce companies are Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm and Snapdeal.

E-commerce company Ebuss wants to build a model that will improve the recommendations given to the users given their past reviews and ratings.

In order to do this, a sentiment-based product recommendation system has been developed. 

The Recommendation system is up and runing on the below url:

All the source code and supported files in github: https://github.com/AhmadShhadeh/sentiment-based-product-recommendation-system

 
Below tasks have been carried out to build the sentiment-based product recommendation system:

Data sourcing and sentiment analysis
Building a recommendation system
Improving the recommendations using the sentiment analysis model
Deploying the end-to-end project with a user interface
